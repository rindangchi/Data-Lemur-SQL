**2. Sending vs. Opening Snaps [Snapchat SQL Interview Question]**

***Question***:

Assume you're given tables with information on Snapchat users, including their ages and time spent sending and opening snaps.
Write a query to obtain a breakdown of the time spent sending vs. opening snaps as a percentage of total time spent on these activities grouped by age group. Round the percentage to 2 decimal places in the output.

Notes:
Calculate the following percentages:
time spent sending / (Time spent sending + Time spent opening)
Time spent opening / (Time spent sending + Time spent opening)
To avoid integer division in percentages, multiply by 100.0 and not 100.

***Answer:***

```sql

with open as 
(

FROM activities act
inner join age_breakdown age
using (user_id)
group by user_id, act.activity_type, age.age_bucket
having activity_type = 'open')

, send as 
(
SELECT act.user_id, age.age_bucket, sum(time_spent) send
FROM activities act
inner join age_breakdown age
using (user_id)
group by user_id, act.activity_type, age.age_bucket
having activity_type = 'send')

select y.age_bucket, round(100.0*(sum_send/(sum_open + sum_send)),2) send_perc,
round(100.0*(sum_open/(sum_open + sum_send)),2) open_perc

from(
select x.age_bucket, sum(open) sum_open, sum(send) sum_send
from(
select * from open
join send 
using (user_id, age_bucket)) x
group by age_bucket ) y

***Question:***

Given a table of tweet data over a specified time period, calculate the 3-day rolling average of tweets for each user. Output the user ID, tweet date, and rolling averages rounded to 2 decimal places.
Notes:
A rolling average, also known as a moving average or running mean is a time-series technique that examines trends in data over a specified period of time.
In this case, we want to determine how the tweet count for each user changes over a 3-day period.
